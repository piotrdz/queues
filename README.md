# Queues - queuing networks simulator

This project was written as part of assignment for my studies. It is a simple simulator of a queue network which allows user to create a queue network, perform a simulation and compute some statistics. Other features include:

 * interactive node editor
 * 5 types of statistics generated on-line during simulation
 * on-line drawing of graphs showing statistics
 * single-stepping/running continuous simulation
 * load and save to file

The project is written in C++11 and uses Qt framework and Qwt library. For instructions see INSTALL.txt.

I probably won't develop this project further but I'm keeping this project here on github as maybe somebody will find it useful.

Everything in the project is distributed under BSD licence (see LICENCE.txt).
